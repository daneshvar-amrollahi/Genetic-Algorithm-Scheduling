This is the third computer assignment of my Artificial Intelligence course at the University of Tehran. 

The problem specified in the description, is the job scheduling problem. There are ```P``` doctors working in a hospital for ```D``` consecutive days in 3 working shifts (Morning, Evening, Night).
There are some constraints on min-max number of doctors available in each shift of each day and also some constraints on consecutive working shifts. 
The code implements the Genetic Algorithm in order to find a suitable schedule. 

My report is available in the notebook.
